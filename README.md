Something new I started learning since July is bartending. I went through some extenuating circumstances last year that caused me to take time off of school, and work full-time to save up money. I was fortunate enough to be granted an exception through the company I work for to work behind the bar at the age of 20. As grateful for this opportunity I am, it made learning how to make drinks and describe the 50 different beers we have on draft to guests extremely hard. I took this as a challenge to do the best I could and prove to myself that I could be a great bartender without tasting any of the drinks, and I did just that.
